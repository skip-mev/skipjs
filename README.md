# skipjs

A util for:

1. Signing and sending bundles of transactions to the [Skip Select auction](https://docs.skip.money)
2. Sending secure transactions through the [Skip Secure RPC](https://docs.skip.money/skip-secure-rpc) to avoid the public mempool

# Usage

For signing and sending bundles, skipjs exposes a single default export, `SkipBundleClient`.
`SkipBundleClient` has two functions:
`signBundle` and `sendBundle`.

```
type SignedBundle = {
  transactions: Array<string>
  pubKey: string
  signature: string
}

async signBundle(transactions: string[], privKey: Uint8Array): SignedBundle

async sendBundle(bundle: SignedBundle, desiredHeight: number, sync?: boolean): Promise<object>
```

For sending secure transactions, skipjs exposes an export, `SkipSecureClient`, with a single function: `sendSecureTransaction`.
```
async sendSecureTransaction(transaction: string)
```

# SkipBundleClient

## signBundle
`signBundle` is used to sign a bundle of transactions. It must be provided with an array of `string`, and a sepc256k1 private key, used to sign the bundle.
The transactions argument should be an array of base64-encoded transaction strings. The encoded bytes can be either Cosmos SDK `TxRaw`s or Ethereum native transactions (such as those produced from `ethers`, for Ethermint EVM chains. See the examples for more details.
`signBundle` returns a `SignedBundle`, which can be passed to `sendBundle` to send the bundle to the Sentinel.

## sendBundle

`sendBundle` sends a `SignedBundle` to the Sentinel.
`desiredHeight` is the desired height for the bundle to be included on-chain. Submitted bundles will only be considered in the auction for this height. Passing `0` as `desiredHeight` will cause the Sentinel to consider the bundle for the immediate next height.
`sync` specifies whether to use the async or sync RPC endpoint. If set to `true`, the promise will not resolve until the bundle has been simulated. If set to `false`, the promise resolves on bundle submission, prior to its simulation.


## Example usage:
### Juno and others using cosmjs
Import `SkipBundleClient`, as well as a way to get an sepc256k1 private key, and other utils for the chain you're using. For this example, we'll use Juno.
```
import { SkipBundleClient } from '@skip-mev/skipjs'
import { getOfflineSignerProto } from 'cosmjs-utils'
import { juno, getSigningCosmosClient, cosmos } from 'juno-network'
import { chains } from 'chain-registry'
```
Create your transactions:
```
const {
    multiSend,
    send
} = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial

var msg = send({
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'ujuno',
        amount: '10'
    }
    ],
    toAddress: toAddress,
    fromAddress: fromAddress
})

var msgToSkipAuctionHouse = send({
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'ujuno',
        amount: '10'
    }
    ],
    toAddress: skipAuctionHouseAddress,
    fromAddress: fromAddress
})

const fee = {
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'ujuno',
        amount: '864'
    }
    ],
    gas: '86364'
}
```

Sign your transactions:
```
const mnemonic = "" // Insert your mnemonic
const signer = await getOfflineSignerProto({
    mnemonic,
    chain: chains.find(({ chain_name }) => chain_name === 'juno')
})

const client = await getSigningCosmosClient({
  rpcEndpoint,
  signer
})

const { accountNumber, sequence } = await client.getSequence(address);
const txRaw = await client.sign(address, [msg, msgToSkipAuctionHouse], fee, '', {
    accountNumber: accountNumber,
    sequence: sequence,
    chainId: 'juno-1'
})
```

Convert your TxRaw into a base64 string:
```
import { TxRaw } from 'cosmjs-types/cosmos/tx/v1beta1/tx.js'
const txString = Buffer.from(TxRaw.encode(txRaw).finish()).toString('base64')
```

Get the secp256k1 private key for signing the bundle.
For example, this can be done with the cosmjs-utils offline signer:
```
const privKey = (await signer.getAccountsWithPrivkeys())[0].privkey
```

Create your SkipBundleClient:
```
const skipBundleClient = new SkipBundleClient(SENTINEL_RPC_ENDPOINT)
```

The RPC endpoint is an `ip:port` string that depends on the chain you're using. Skip Sentinel endpoints for each chain can be found [here](https://docs.skip.money/chain-configuration).

Sign and send your bundle:
```
const signedBundle = await skipBundleClient.signBundle([txString], privKey)
const sendBundleResponse = await skipBundleClient.sendBundle(signedBundle, DESIRED_HEIGHT_FOR_BUNDLE, true)
```

`DESIRED_HEIGHT_FOR_BUNDLE` should be a number, where 0 asks the Sentinel to autodetermine the next height.
### Terra and [Alliance](https://github.com/terra-money/alliance) chains use an alternative client library called [feather.js](https://github.com/terra-money/feather.js).
The overall logic is similar to using cosmjs. Modified from the [send native token example](https://docs.terra.money/develop/feather-js/common-examples#sending-native-tokens).

Import Skip and feather.js.
```
import { SkipBundleClient } from '@skip-mev/skipjs'
import { LCDClient, MnemonicKey, MsgSend } from '@terra-money/feather.js'
```

Create LCD and get mnemonic key.
```
const lcd = new LCDClient({
    URL: LCD_ENDPOINT,
    chainID: CHAIN_ID,
})

const mk = new MnemonicKey({
  mnemonic:'', // Insert your mnemonic
})
const wallet = lcd.wallet(mk)
const privKey = mk.privateKey
```

Construct message of sending token to your destination destination and another to [skip auction house address](https://docs.skip.money/searcher#winning-the-auction).
```
const sendToYourDestination = new MsgSend(
  wallet.key.accAddress('terra'), // requires prefix as a parameter
  'TO_ADDRESS',
  { uluna: '1000000' },
)
const sendToSkipAuctionHouse = new MsgSend(
  wallet.key.accAddress('terra'), // requires prefix as a parameter
  'SKIP_AUCTION_HOUSE_ADDRESS', // replace this with skip auction house address on the corresponding chain and network
  { uluna: '1000000' }, // amount you send to skip to bid your tx
)
```

Create the tx and convert it to base64 string.
```
const tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({ msgs: [sendToYourDestination, sendToSkipAuctionHouse] })
const txString = Buffer.from(tx.toBytes()).toString('base64')
```

Create skip client and send your bundle!
```
const skipBundleClient = new SkipBundleClient(SENTINEL_RPC_ENDPOINT)
const signedBundle = await skipBundleClient.signBundle([txString], privKey)
return await skipBundleClient.sendBundle(signedBundle, DESIRED_HEIGHT_FOR_BUNDLE, true)
```
`DESIRED_HEIGHT_FOR_BUNDLE` should be a number, where 0 asks the Sentinel to autodetermine the next height.
# SkipSecureClient

## sendSecureTransaction
`sendSecureTransaction` is used to send transactions privately through the [Skip Secure RPC](https://docs.skip.money/skip-secure-rpc) to keep the transaction hidden from the public mempool. The Sentinel attempts to privately send the transaction to a proposer participating in Skip Select for 5 minutes until discarding the transaction: 

1. It takes a single transaction
2. The memo of the transaction must be equal to the sender's address

## Example usage:

Import `SkipSecureClient`, as well as other utils for generating transactions for the chain you're using. For this example, we'll use Juno.
```
import { SkipSecureClient } from '@skip-mev/skipjs'
import { getOfflineSignerProto } from 'cosmjs-utils'
import { juno, getSigningCosmosClient, cosmos } from 'juno-network'
import { chains } from 'chain-registry'
```
Create your transactions:
```
const {
    multiSend,
    send
} = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial

var msg = send({
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'ujuno',
        amount: '10'
    }
    ],
    toAddress: toAddress,
    fromAddress: fromAddress
})

const fee = {
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'ujuno',
        amount: '864'
    }
    ],
    gas: '86364'
}
```

Sign your transactions. Note that the memo of the transaction must be the same as the sender address in order to be accepted by the Sentinel.
```
const mnemonic = "" // Insert your mnemonic
const signer = await getOfflineSignerProto({
    mnemonic,
    chain: chains.find(({ chain_name }) => chain_name === 'juno')
})

const client = await getSigningCosmosClient({
  rpcEndpoint,
  signer
})

const { accountNumber, sequence } = await client.getSequence(address);
// Note that we use the address for the memo.
const txRaw = await client.sign(address, [msg], fee, address, {
    accountNumber: accountNumber,
    sequence: sequence,
    chainId: 'juno-1'
})
```

Convert your TxRaw into a base64 string:
```
import { TxRaw } from 'cosmjs-types/cosmos/tx/v1beta1/tx.js'
const txString = Buffer.from(TxRaw.encode(txRaw).finish()).toString('base64')
```

Create your SkipSecureClient:
```
const skipSecureClient = new SkipSecureClient(SENTINEL_RPC_ENDPOINT)
```

The RPC endpoint is an `ip:port` string that depends on the chain you're using. Skip Sentinel endpoints for each chain can be found [here](https://docs.skip.money/chain-configuration).

Send your secure transaction:
```
const sendSecureTransactionResponse = await skipSecureClient.sendSecureTransaction(txString)
```
